## Project Introduction

The purpose of this project was to create a travel blog. The blog was developed with React and Next.js based on a Figma design. I used Strapi as a headless CMS for content management and API integration.

## Features

- Designed interface based on a custom Figma design.
- The three latest blog posts on homepage.
- Date, day and post title visible at first glance
- Responsive layout for optimal viewing on all devices.
- Dynamic content management using Strapi as a headless CMS.
- Integrated API for fetching content.

### Deployment

## Development Tools

To maintain consistent and well-formatted code, I used the [Prettier Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) in Visual Studio Code.
